# IIR-Watson
IBM Watson Implementation as part of the Information Retrieval and Web Search Class (CSC 583)

This model allows a user to perform two functions:

1. Ask a query. 
	The result of this will be the Wikipedia page title and its score in descending order.
2. Evaluate the dataset
	The result of this will be the P@1 precision score of the training data based on the evaluation question set.

Two models are available for the user to choose from:

1. A naive model - P@1 of 19
2. An improved model - P@1 of 29
